Title: Nonnegative Integer Solutions of Linear Diophantine Equations
        with Applications
Date: 2021-12-17
Description: Routines for enumerating all existing nonnegative integer solutions of a linear Diophantine equation. The package provides routines for solving 0-1, bounded and unbounded knapsack problems; 0-1, bounded and unbounded subset sum problems; additive partitioning of natural numbers; and one-dimensional bin-packing problem.
