\title{Enumeration of all existing 0-1 and bounded solutions of a subset sum problem}
\description{By default this function solves the following 0-1 subset sum problem.
Given the set of positive integers \code{(a_1, a_2, ..., a_l)} and a positive integer \code{n}, find all non-empty subsets that sum to \code{n}, so that each of the integers \code{a_i} either appears in the subset or it does not, and the total number of summands should not exceed \code{M}, \code{M <= n}.

The bounded subset sum problem has restrictions on the number of times (bounds) \code{a_i} can turn up in the subset.
  
 The algorithm is based on a generating function of Hardy and Littlewood used by Voinov and Nikulin (1997).

\usage{
 get.subsetsum(a,n,M=NULL,problem="subsetsum01",bounds=NULL)

}
\arguments{
   \item{a}{An \code{l}-vector of positive integers with \code{l>= 2}.}
   \item{n}{A positive integer.}
    \item{M}{A positive integer, the maximum number of summands, \code{M <= n}} 
    \item{problem}{one of the two problems to be solved: "subsetsum01" (default) for a 0-1 subset sum problem, 
         or "bsubsetsum" a bounded subset sum problem.}
    \item{bounds}{An \code{l}-vector of positive integers, bounds for \eqn{s_i}, i.e. \eqn{0 <= s_i <= b_i}}
}

\value{
  \item{p.n}{total number of solutions obtained.}
  \item{solutions}{a matrix with each column presenting a solution for \code{n}.}
